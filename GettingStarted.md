3. The basic configuration is done through substitions
	1. font_size: Make sure the font sizes match the font sizes set above
	2. font_size_width_ratio: The width:height ratio of the font used
	3. header_height: Customize the header height
	4. margin_size: Customize the margin
	5. bottom_bar_margin: Distance the media duration bar is from the bottom
	6. scroll_bar_width: Customize the width of the scrollbar
	7. icon_size: Size of icons used to calculate UI
